# stableselectron2

Re-factor of StableElectron. Much more performant, removed feature bloat, and the code base is much nicer, meaning I'll be able to open it up a year from now and understand what is going on.

Vintage UI look / feel for this iteration. Used html + css for most components this round, rather than relying on MUI. I did however use MUI for the left and right page buttons, though.

Or, if you are tech savy, just clone the repo and install deps, run in dev mode (`npm run dev`) or build with `electron-builder`.
